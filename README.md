# Telecom-Project-Identifying-Ineffective-Operators

This was my final project for the Practicum100.

The virtual telephony service is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness.


The libraries that I used: pandas, sweetviz, datetime, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy.
The datasets are from the Practicum100 and are not allowed to share.
